# Feature Specification: Detailed Service Specifications

**Feature Branch**: `003-th√™m-chi-ti·∫øt`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Th√™m chi ti·∫øt: - identity-service: OAuth2/SSO, MFA OTP. - proctoring-service: Face detection v·ªõi Gemini AI, ph√°t hi·ªán copy/paste. - copyright-service: SHA-256 hash, Ethereum smart contract l∆∞u metadata, frontend upload/verify. - token-reward-service: Multisig wallet, giao d·ªãch ERC-20. ƒê·ªçc danh s√°ch ki·ªÉm tra ƒë√°nh gi√°, ƒë√°nh d·∫•u c√°c m·ª•c ƒë√°p ·ª©ng."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to use a secure and feature-rich online exam system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to log in, **When** they use a third-party account (SSO), **Then** they should be successfully authenticated.
2. **Given** a user is taking an exam, **When** the system detects suspicious activity (face detection, copy/paste), **Then** the activity is flagged for review.
3. **Given** a content creator wants to protect their work, **When** they upload a document, **Then** the system generates a unique fingerprint and stores it on the blockchain.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the third-party SSO provider is down?
- What happens if the AI proctoring system incorrectly flags a user?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: `identity-service` MUST support OAuth2/SSO for authentication.
- **FR-002**: `identity-service` MUST support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with One-Time Passwords (OTP).
- **FR-003**: `proctoring-service` MUST use AI for face detection to monitor students during exams.
- **FR-004**: `proctoring-service` MUST detect copy/paste actions during an exam.
- **FR-005**: `copyright-service` MUST use SHA-256 to hash documents.
- **FR-006**: `copyright-service` MUST store document metadata in an Ethereum smart contract.
- **FR-007**: `copyright-service` MUST provide a frontend for users to upload and verify documents.
- **FR-008**: `token-reward-service` MUST use a multisig wallet for managing tokens.
- **FR-009**: `token-reward-service` MUST support ERC-20 token transactions.
